# Changelog

## [Phase 1] — 2026-03-02 (T002 CharacterController + T003/T004 ComboSystem — DONE)

### Completed
- **T002: CharacterController2D — belt-scroll rework** — 5 code files + 3 editor/test files
  - CharacterMotor: belt-scroll movement (XY ground plane, simulated jump height, no gravity)
  - MovementStateMachine: plain C# state machine (Grounded/Airborne/Dashing)
  - MovementConfig: ScriptableObject with all tuning params
  - CharacterInputHandler: Unity new Input System (InputActionReference)
  - MovementState: 3-state enum
  - 17 edit-mode unit tests for MovementStateMachine

- **T003: InputBufferSystem** — embedded in ComboStateMachine
  - Input buffering during Attacking state, consumed on ComboWindow open

- **T004: ComboSystem — light/heavy chains, finishers** — 7 code files + 1 test file
  - AttackType: Light/Heavy enum
  - ComboState: Idle/Attacking/ComboWindow/Finisher enum
  - ComboStep: serializable struct with branching tree indices (nextOnLight/nextOnHeavy)
  - ComboDefinition: ScriptableObject with flat step array, root indices, per-step window overrides
  - ComboStateMachine: plain C# state machine — input buffering, combo window timer, animation event callbacks
  - ComboController: MonoBehaviour — input → state machine → animation → events
  - ComboDebugUI: debug overlay with auto-advance (simulates animation events when no Animator present)
  - 25 edit-mode unit tests for ComboStateMachine

### Design Decisions
- Belt-scroll movement model (Streets of Rage style): X=horizontal, Y=depth, jump=sprite offset
- No ground collider — grounded is purely `jumpHeight <= 0`
- DD-1: Branching combo tree (L→L→H vs L→L→L) for deep combat variety
- DD-2: Flat array with index pointers — simple inspector authoring
- DD-3: Local C# events (AttackStarted/ComboDropped/FinisherStarted/ComboEnded)
- DD-4: Plain C# state machine with Tick(dt) — testable without Unity runtime

## [Phase 1] — 2026-03-02

### Completed
- T001: Shared Interfaces, Enums, and Data Structures — 20 files across 4 directories
  - 6 interfaces: ICombatEvents, IBuffProvider, IPathProvider, IDamageable, IAttacker, IRunProgressionEvents
  - 9 enums: CharacterType, DamageType, DamageResponse, PathType, RitualTrigger, RitualFamily, RitualCategory, StatType, TelegraphType
  - 4 data files: DamagePacket, CombatEventData (13 structs), RunEventData (7 structs), PlaceholderTypes
  - 4 assembly definitions enforcing pillar boundaries

### Notes
- Used readonly structs for all event data (immutable by design)
- PlaceholderTypes added for future task dependencies (T005, T008, T021, T028)
- ICombatEvents expanded to 13 events (spec called for 12, added PathAbilityUsed)
