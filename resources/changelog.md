# Changelog

## [Phase 1] — 2026-03-02

### Completed
- T001: Shared Interfaces, Enums, and Data Structures — 20 files across 4 directories
  - 6 interfaces: ICombatEvents, IBuffProvider, IPathProvider, IDamageable, IAttacker, IRunProgressionEvents
  - 9 enums: CharacterType, DamageType, DamageResponse, PathType, RitualTrigger, RitualFamily, RitualCategory, StatType, TelegraphType
  - 4 data files: DamagePacket, CombatEventData (13 structs), RunEventData (7 structs), PlaceholderTypes
  - 4 assembly definitions enforcing pillar boundaries

### Notes
- Used readonly structs for all event data (immutable by design)
- PlaceholderTypes added for future task dependencies (T005, T008, T021, T028)
- ICombatEvents expanded to 13 events (spec called for 12, added PathAbilityUsed)
